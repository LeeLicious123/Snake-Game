Wow here is me trying to build my first ever game and what better one to start with an all-time classic!

This is a re-creation of the Retro Snake Game inspired by the iconic Nokia Snake game using vanilla HMTL, CSS and JavaScript! 

Using JS I learnt to draw the game board, create the snake and randomly generated food, make the snake move, increase the snake size when it eats and increase its speed. 
As well as this, I learnt how to keep score, track collisions for the snake, and display your own high score. 

Try and beat my high score of 121!
